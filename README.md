# Schadt_CSCI2270_FinalProject

I will make a role playing figher game. I am not yet sure of what theme I will choose, but the game will have various levels with a combat system of its own.
I will use graphs as my data structure. Each node in the graph will be a different level with a different difficulty etc. 
I may also implement a linked list as a way of storing certain character traits, but am not completely sure as I have not yet started the code.
